### Introduction
This repository hosts the version of the code used for the **[publication](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v143/lalit21a.html)** **Embedding-based Instance Segmentation of Microscopy Images**. 

We refer to the techniques elaborated in the publication, here as **EmbedSeg**. `EmbedSeg` is a method to perform instance-segmentation of objects in microscopy images, based on the ideas by **[Neven et al, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11109)**. 

With `EmbedSeg`, we obtain state-of-the-art results on multiple real-world microscopy datasets. `EmbedSeg` has a small enough memory footprint (between 0.7 to about 3 GB) to allow network training on virtually all CUDA enabled hardware, including laptops.


### Dependencies 

One could execute these lines of code to run this branch with GPU support:

```
conda create -n EmbedSeg python==3.9
conda activate EmbedSeg
conda install pytorch torchvision pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia
git clone https://github.com/juglab/EmbedSeg.git
cd EmbedSeg
pip install -e .
```

For CPU support, one could execute the following lines of code:


```
conda create -n EmbedSeg python==3.9
conda activate EmbedSeg
pip install torch torchvision
git clone https://github.com/juglab/EmbedSeg.git
cd EmbedSeg
```

### Getting Started

Look in the `examples` directory,  and try out the `DSB-2018` notebooks for 2D images or `Mouse-Organoid-Cells-CBG` notebooks for volumetric (3D) images. Please make sure to select `Kernel > Change kernel` to `EmbedSegEnv`.   


### Datasets
3D datasets are available as release assets **[here](https://github.com/juglab/EmbedSeg/releases/tag/v0.1.0)**. 
![datasets](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34229641/118558022-5bd27b00-b766-11eb-889b-00886b725c2a.png)

### Training and Inference on your data
   
`*.tif`-type images and the corresponding masks should be respectively present under `images` and `masks`, under directories `train`, `val` and `test`. (In order to prepare such instance masks, one could use the Fiji plugin <b>Labkit</b> as suggested <b>[here](https://github.com/juglab/EmbedSeg/wiki/01---Use-Labkit-to-prepare-instance-masks)</b>). The following would be a desired structure as to how data should be prepared.

```
$data_dir
└───$project-name
    |───train
        └───images
            └───X0.tif
            └───...
            └───Xn.tif
        └───masks
            └───Y0.tif
            └───...
            └───Yn.tif
    |───val
        └───images
            └───...
        └───masks
            └───...
    |───test
        └───images
            └───...
        └───masks
            └───...
```
